# KaibaViewer

Kaiba Viewer Swift application

## Development

```bash
mise install
mise run build
mise run test
swift run kaiba-viewer --help
```

The package uses Swift Package Manager with:

- Library target: `KaibaViewerCore`
- Executable target: `KaibaViewerCLI`
- Installed executable: `kaiba-viewer`

Swift target names and type names must be valid Swift identifiers. If the project
name contains hyphens, keep `PROJECT_NAME` and `EXECUTABLE_NAME` hyphenated as
needed, but use identifier-safe values such as `AppCore`, `AppCLI`, and
`AppCommand` for Swift module/type variables.

## Homebrew Formula

Build local formula archives:

```bash
mise run build:homebrew -- darwin-arm64 darwin-x64
```

Render a formula after both platform archives exist:

```bash
mise run homebrew:formula -- 0.1.0
```

Render directly into the default sibling tap checkout:

```bash
mise run homebrew:tap-formula -- 0.1.0
```

Install from the tap after the formula is published:

```bash
brew tap tacogips/homebrew-tap
brew install kaiba-viewer
```

## Homebrew Cask

The Cask workflow builds signed, notarized, and stapled macOS DMG artifacts.
Apple signing credentials must stay local and must not be committed.

Check the build plan:

```bash
mise run build:homebrew-cask -- --dry-run darwin-arm64 darwin-x64
```

Build with local signing credentials:

```bash
kinko exec --env APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY,APPLE_ID,APPLE_PASSWORD,APPLE_TEAM_ID -- \
  mise run build:homebrew-cask -- darwin-arm64 darwin-x64
```

Render a Cask:

```bash
mise run homebrew:cask -- 0.1.0
```

For a tagged release, build, upload, and render the tap Cask:

```bash
kinko exec --env APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY,APPLE_ID,APPLE_PASSWORD,APPLE_TEAM_ID -- \
  mise run release:homebrew-cask-local -- v0.1.0
```
